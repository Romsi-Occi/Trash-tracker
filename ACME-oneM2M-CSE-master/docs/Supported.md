# Limitations
- **This is by no means a fully compliant, secure, fast, or stable CSE! Don't use it in production.**
- This CSE is intended for educational purposes. The underlying database system is not optimized in any way for high-volume, high-availability, or high-reliability.
- Unsupported resource types are just stored, but no check or functionality is provided for those resources. The same is true for unknown resource attributes.
